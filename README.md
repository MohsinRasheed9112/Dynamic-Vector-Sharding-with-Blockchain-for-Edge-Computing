# Dynamic-Vector-Sharding-with-Blockchain-for-Edge-Computing
This project develops a dynamic vector sharding strategy for managing high-dimensional data in edge computing. It adjusts shard boundaries in real-time based on memory usage and integrates a lightweight blockchain for secure, tamper-proof shard updates. This approach optimizes performance, load distribution, and fault tolerance.
